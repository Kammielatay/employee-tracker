# Employee-tracker

## Description

Developers are often tasked with creating interfaces that make it easy for non-developers to view and interact with information stored in databases. Often these interfaces are known as Content Management Systems. The challenge is to architect and build a solution for managing a company's employees using node, inquirer, and MySQL.

This week I was tasked with the challenge to understand CRUD and relational databases. Using this application, you have the ability to create, update, and view all the employees. 

Because this application cannot be deployed on Github, you will find a walk through of the functionality under the Usage section.
